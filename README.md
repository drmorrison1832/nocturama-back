# Nocturama Backend

_This readme was created by GitHub Copilot and needs to be reviewed._

**Nocturama-back** is my first attemp of a fully functionnal backend for a bookstoreâ€™s website featuring an agenda.
This backend aims tp manage user accounts and articles.
It is developed _ad honorem_ and still is work in progress.
A backoffice must be build (I currently access the API using Postman), and many things are are still to finish or to improve (for example, the database schemas and collections must be costomized)..
It's React frontend is also work in progress.

- **Email** is validated and sanitized.
- **Rate limiting** is applied to all routes.
- **Input validation** is enforced for all user and article data.
- **Token expiration** and sliding expiration are implemented.
- **Sensitive fields** (like password hash and salt) are never exposed in API responses.
